## Machine Learning & NLP Projects  

This repository contains a collection of my Machine Learning and Data Science projects. Each project explores different ML techniques, from classical regression models to NLP-based sentiment analysis.  

## 📂 Projects  

### 🔹 Regression  
- **Linear Regression** → Predicting continuous values with evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R².  
- **Multiple Regression** → Handling multiple predictors for better accuracy.  

### 🔹 Decision Tree  
- Implemented Decision Tree models for classification & regression tasks.  
- Visualized tree splits and feature importance.  

### 🔹 Classification (KNN & Others)  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification tasks.  
- Compared results with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).  

### 🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.  
- Vectorization techniques: Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings.  

### 🔹 Sentiment Analysis  
- Analyzed text data (e.g., reviews/tweets) to predict sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).  
- Built classification pipelines with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Deep Learning (optional).  

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.  
- Insights through statistical analysis, correlations, and feature engineering.
